Sample output.

This will continue to grow and have more features.

As of now It only include a class for Right Triangle Trig, main file (for testing), and a constants file.
The constants file will be a list of constants I make along the way. I intend on building my own math library.
I know it's like re-inventing the wheel but I really like being able to do it in a way that I find useful and
can use it to build upon for other things. 

Goals...

As a thought on what I might *try and do, I really like OpenCV and would like to maybe find a way
instead of boxes to identify things but a relational triangle that uses my functions to calculate
the height of a given object. (hopefully accurately) Or at least analyze a photo and create an app
that can assist welders or whatever. Its brainstorming and I hope It gets somewhere. Stay tuned and 
don't be afraid to make any critisisms. I appreciate all input and just know that It is far from done.
Thank you!

# -------------------------------- Constants.py ------------------------------

Added some of the constants. I am not sure of the use cases yet. I just have
them in a format that is easily accessed and a help function to explain them.
It isn't very usefull at the moment but It will be a library of them anyway.
I think this whole project will turn into more of a python math journal. I don't know
Just flying by the seat of my pants because I am having fun doing it.
